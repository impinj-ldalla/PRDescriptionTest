# PR Template Test Repository

This repository was created to test and validate a **Pull Request (PR) template**. The goal is to ensure that the template provides clear guidelines for contributors when submitting PRs, improving the quality and consistency of code reviews.

## Purpose

- Validate the structure and formatting of a PR template.
- Ensure the required sections (e.g., description, checklist, related issues) are properly formatted.
- Test how the template appears in GitHub's PR submission workflow.

## How to Test

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b test-pr-template
   ```
3. Make any sample changes.
4. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
5. Verify that the PR template appears as expected.
6. Submit the PR and review the formatting and structure.

## Expected Outcome

- The PR template should be automatically populated when opening a new PR.
- All required sections should be visible and well-structured.
